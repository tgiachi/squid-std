# Host SquidStd in an ASP.NET Core app

Wire SquidStd into an ASP.NET Core Minimal API and expose its health checks over HTTP.

## What you'll build

A Minimal API web app that uses SquidStd (`SquidStd.AspNetCore`) as its DryIoc-backed service provider, surfaces
the registered SquidStd health checks at `/health`, and answers a simple root endpoint.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 10 SDK
- `dotnet add package SquidStd.AspNetCore`

## Steps

### 1. Register SquidStd on the builder

`UseSquidStd` swaps in DryIoc as the ASP.NET Core service provider and bootstraps SquidStd. The root directory is
taken from the host environment automatically, so you only set the config name. The bootstrap registers only the
configuration core; pass a container callback as the second argument and call `RegisterCoreServices()` there to
bring up the core services.

[!code-csharp[](../../samples/SquidStd.Samples.AspNetCore/Program.cs#step-1)]

### 2. Bridge the health checks

`AddSquidStdHealthChecks` registers every SquidStd `IHealthCheck` as a standard ASP.NET Core health check. Call it
after `UseSquidStd`.

[!code-csharp[](../../samples/SquidStd.Samples.AspNetCore/Program.cs#step-2)]

### 3. Build the app and map endpoints

Build the app, expose the health checks with the standard `MapHealthChecks`, add a root endpoint, and run.

## Unified Serilog logging

Add `AddSquidStdSerilog()` to send ASP.NET Core framework logs (Kestrel, `Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime`)
through the same Serilog logger SquidStd configures from `squidstd.yaml`, giving a single format and a
single configuration source:

```csharp
builder.UseSquidStd(options => options.ConfigName = "squidstd", c => c.RegisterCoreServices());
builder.AddSquidStdSerilog();
builder.AddSquidStdHealthChecks();
```

Without this call the two loggers stay separate (two console formats). With it, `squidstd.yaml` drives
all logging.

## Run it

```bash
dotnet run --project samples/SquidStd.Samples.AspNetCore
```

Browse to `/` for the "SquidStd up" message and to `/health` for the aggregated health-check status.

## How it works

`UseSquidStd` creates an owned DryIoc container, registers it through `DryIocServiceProviderFactory`, and hooks the
SquidStd lifecycle into the ASP.NET Core host via a hosted service. `AddSquidStdHealthChecks` resolves the SquidStd
`IHealthCheck` instances from that container and adapts each one into the standard health-check pipeline, so
`MapHealthChecks` reports them like any other ASP.NET Core check.
